# Assignment: Hero Layout Clone

## Objective

Recreate the given hero page design from the provided screenshot using semantic HTML and CSS Flexbox. Your goal is to match layout, colors, spacing, and typography as closely as possible.

## Design Challenge Preview

![Day 09 hero layout](screenshots/mohammad-bin-zayed-university-of-artificial-intelligence-banner-and-navigation-design.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Mobile-first design approach will be covered along with media queries in coming days. This desktop layout will surely break on mobile devices. Do not panic about it.

## Instructions

### Deliverables Details

- [ ] An HTML file linked to a custom external CSS file
- [ ] Page uses a centered container with a max width of 1200px

> [!TIP]
> The centered container is to limit the contents from stretching to preserve the layout, while the background color expands to full screen width.

- [ ] Two stacked navbars (top light, bottom sand-colored)
- [ ] Hero (banner) section split into two columns (left text, right info panel + image)

> [!TIP]
>
> - Study how `object-fit` and `object-position` are useful with intrinsic sizing of elements.
> - Study how to add background images using CSS. Images are already provided under `assets/` folder.

- [ ] The hero (banner) background is a solid blue matching the design
- [ ] All colors and font sizes match the specifications below

> [!TIP]
> Try creating the layout first, then defining the images and contents.

## Layout Notes

> [!TIP]
> To be able to give 100% height to **intrinsic** sized elements, their parent elements must have `relative` positioning.

- Use flexbox to align items in navbars and the hero columns.
- The right info panel contains two vertical sections: text + button on top, and the image at the bottom.
- The right panel uses a background image (banner) behind the content.
- The image fills its container width and height without distortion.
- Study the `object-fit` property for controlling how replaced elements (like images) are resized within their containers.[^1]

## Footnotes

[^1]: An element's **intrinsic size** is the size it would have based purely on its content, without taking into account the effects of the layout context it appears in. This is the opposite of an element's **extrinsic size**, which is determined by external constraints such as container size. An element's intrinsic sizes are represented by its `min-content` and `max-content` sizes. The `object-fit` property becomes particularly useful when working with intrinsic-sized elements like images, allowing you to control how they scale and position within their containers.
